echo "Trendline-Generation is a Python tool that implements linear regression to create resistance and support trendlines for Financial Time Series Data. It utilizes linear regression to generate regression lines, identifying pivot points using an accuracy-based approach. Additionally, it develops resistance and support trendlines parallel to the best-fit regression line with the y-intercept as a variable parameter. The tool also implements binary search to calculate y-intercepts, ensuring no intersection of trend lines with the candlestick data. Moreover, it introduces an Epsilon parameter to define permissible wick intersections, enhancing the precision of the analysis." >> README.md
